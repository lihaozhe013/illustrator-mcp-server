An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for reading, manipulating, and exporting Adobe Illustrator design data — with 66 built-in tools.

Control Illustrator directly from AI assistants like Claude — extract design information for web implementation, verify print-ready data, and export assets.

Everything Adobe's official Illustrator MCP (beta) can do — and more. See the [comparison](#-comparison-with-adobes-official-illustrator-mcp).

> [!NOTE]
> In Claude's extension directory and plugin marketplace, this project is listed as **Design Bridge by IE3**. Anthropic's directories don't allow other companies' brand names in listing names, so the listing name differs — it is the same project, and the npm package is still `illustrator-mcp-server`. If you installed the Claude Code plugin under its earlier name (`illustrator@ie3jp-illustrator`), see [Claude Code](#-quick-start) to reinstall it.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🛠️ Claude Code

Requires [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
claude mcp add illustrator-mcp -- npx illustrator-mcp-server
```

Or install it as a plugin, which bundles the MCP server with a pre-press preflight skill (also works in Claude Cowork):

```
/plugin install ie3-design-bridge --marketplace ie3jp/illustrator-mcp-server
```

On Claude Code earlier than v2.1.275, add the marketplace first:

```
/plugin marketplace add ie3jp/illustrator-mcp-server
/plugin install ie3-design-bridge@ie3
```

If you already added the server with `claude mcp add`, remove it first (`claude mcp remove illustrator-mcp`) so it doesn't run twice.

### 🖥️ Claude Desktop

1. Download **`illustrator-mcp-server.mcpb`** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ie3jp/illustrator-mcp-server/releases/latest)
2. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings** → **Extensions**
3. Drag and drop the `.mcpb` file into the Extensions panel
4. Click the **Install** button

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: manual config (always up to date via npx)</strong></summary>

> [!NOTE]
> The `.mcpb` extension does not auto-update. To update, download the new version and reinstall. If you prefer automatic updates, use the npx method below instead.

Requires [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/). Open the config file and add the connection settings.

#### 1. Open the config file

From the Claude Desktop menu bar:

**Claude** → **Settings...** → **Developer** (in the left sidebar) → Click the **Edit Config** button

#### 2. Add the settings

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "illustrator": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["illustrator-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you installed Node.js via a version manager (nvm, mise, fnm, etc.), Claude Desktop may not find `npx`. In that case, use the full path:
> ```json
> "command": "/full/path/to/npx"
> ```
> Run `which npx` in your terminal to find the path.

#### 3. Save and restart

1. Save the file and close the text editor
2. **Fully quit** Claude Desktop (⌘Q / Ctrl+Q) and reopen it

</details>

> [!CAUTION]
> AI can make mistakes. Do not over-rely on the output — **always have a human perform the final check on submission data**. The user is responsible for the results.

> [!NOTE]
> **macOS:** On first run, allow automation access in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation.

> [!NOTE]
> Most modify tools bring Illustrator to the foreground during execution. Read tools and `export` run without switching apps; `export_pdf` brings Illustrator forward only when drawing Japanese crop marks.

> [!NOTE]
> **Your files are protected by default.** `close_document` will not throw away unsaved changes unless you explicitly choose to (`save: false`), and `export`, `export_pdf`, `save_document` (save as) and `extract_design_tokens` will not replace an existing file unless `overwrite: true` is set. If that is what you want, just tell Claude to "close without saving" or "overwrite the file".

### Multiple Illustrator Versions

If you have multiple versions of Illustrator installed, you can tell Claude which version to use during conversation. Just say something like "Use Illustrator 2024" and the `set_illustrator_version` tool will target that version.


**Supported versions:** Illustrator 2024 (v28) and later are verified. Illustrator 2020–2023 (v24–v27) are expected to work — every ExtendScript API this server uses has existed since v24 — but they are **not verified**, so tools return a warning when running on them. Versions older than 2020 (v24) are rejected. If something breaks on an unverified version, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ie3jp/illustrator-mcp-server/issues).
> [!NOTE]
> If Illustrator is already running, the server connects to the running instance regardless of the version setting. The version is only used to launch the correct version when Illustrator is not yet running.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ILLUSTRATOR_MCP_TIMEOUT_NORMAL` | `30000` | Timeout in milliseconds for normal tools |
| `ILLUSTRATOR_MCP_TIMEOUT_HEAVY` | `60000` | Timeout in milliseconds for heavy tools (placing or importing files, export, preflight, style guides and color chips, size variations) |

Raise these when a single call needs longer than the default: importing a large SVG with `import_svg_as_editable` (100+ objects), or running `get_document_structure` / `export_pdf` on a big document.

Values must be positive integers in milliseconds. Anything else (`0`, a negative number, a non-numeric string, or a value above 2147483647) falls back to the default. They are read once at server startup.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "illustrator": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["illustrator-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ILLUSTRATOR_MCP_TIMEOUT_NORMAL": "60000",
        "ILLUSTRATOR_MCP_TIMEOUT_HEAVY": "180000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎬 What You Can Do

```
You:    Show me all the text information in this document
Claude:  → list_text_frames → get_text_frame_detail
         There are 12 text frames in the document.
         The heading "My Design" uses Noto Sans JP Bold 48px, color #333333 ...
```

```
You:    Run a pre-press preflight check
Claude:  → preflight_check
         ⚠ 2 warnings:
         - Low resolution image: image_01.jpg (150dpi) — 300dpi or higher recommended
         - Non-outlined fonts: 3 text frames
```

```
You:    Check text for inconsistencies
Claude:  → check_text_consistency
         📝 Consistency Report:
         ⚠ "Contact Us" vs "Contact us" — capitalization mismatch
         ❌ "Lorem ipsum" (2 places) — placeholder text remaining
```

```
You:    Create banner size variations from this A4 flyer
Claude:  → get_document_info → resize_for_variation
         Created 3 size variations:
         - 728×90 / 300×250 / 160×600
```

## 🆚 Comparison with Adobe's Official Illustrator MCP

**In short: everything the official MCP does, this project does too — plus a lot more.** Adobe ships a built-in MCP server in **Illustrator Beta** (30.4+, still beta-only as of August 2026), focused on analyzing and batch-processing existing documents. This project covers those same workflows — analysis, bulk recoloring, variations, batch artboard export, font / broken-link checks — and adds what the official server doesn't have: **creating artwork from scratch, saving documents, print & prepress checks, and design-system tools**. And it runs on stable Illustrator, no beta required.

| | This project | Adobe official MCP (beta) |
|---|---|---|
| Installation | npm (`npx illustrator-mcp-server`) or one-click `.mcpb` install | Built into Illustrator Beta — get an auth key + URL from the app settings, connect via `mcp-remote` |
| Supported versions | Illustrator 2024+ verified / 2020+ unverified (macOS / Windows) | Illustrator Beta 30.4+ only |
| Number of tools | 66 | ~40 |
| Analyzing & batch-processing existing documents | ✅ Structure / color / font analysis, bulk recolor, variations & datasets, batch artboard export (`artboard:all`), font & broken-link preflight | ✅ Its main focus |
| Creating objects from scratch | ✅ Full set — documents, shapes, paths, text frames, path text, gradients | ❌ No new objects, text frames, or documents \* |
| Saving documents | ✅ `save_document` (save / save-as) | ❌ Export only \* |
| Print & prepress | ✅ Crop marks, preflight, overprint / separation info, outlines, color profiles | — |
| Design system | ✅ Design tokens, WCAG contrast check, style guides, text consistency | — |

\* Based on user reports as of April 2026 (beta). The official server is under active development — see [Adobe's documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/desktop/connect-with-other-apps-and-tools/about-using-ai-tools-with-illustrator.html) for the latest status.

## 📖 Recipes

<details>
<summary><b>Extract colors and fonts for CSS</b></summary>

```
You:    Summarize the colors and typography in this design

Claude:  → get_colors → list_text_frames → get_text_frame_detail

         ■ Color Palette
         - Primary: #1A73E8 (CMYK: 85,50,0,0)
         - Secondary: #34A853
         - Text: #202124
         - Background: #FFFFFF

         ■ Typography
         - Headings: Noto Sans JP Bold / 32px
         - Body: Noto Sans JP Regular / 16px / line-height: 1.75
         - Captions: Noto Sans JP Medium / 12px
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Export artboards as SVG / PNG</b></summary>

```
You:    Export all artboards as SVG with outlined text

Claude:  → get_artboards → convert_to_outlines → export (repeated)

         Exported 4 artboards:
         - /output/header.svg
         - /output/hero.svg
         - /output/feature.svg
         - /output/footer.svg
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Check PDF/X-1a compliance before submission</b></summary>

```
You:    Check if this document is PDF/X-1a compliant

Claude:  → preflight_check (target_pdf_profile: "x1a")

         ❌ PDF/X-1a compliance errors:
         - Transparency on 3 objects (X-1a prohibits transparency)
         - RGB colors found in 2 places (X-1a requires CMYK/spot only)

         ⚠ Warnings:
         - 5 non-outlined fonts (embedding recommended)
         - Image "photo_02.jpg" at 150dpi (300dpi recommended)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Check image quality for print</b></summary>

```
You:    Check placed image quality for print

Claude:  → get_images (include_print_info: true)

         ■ Image Quality Report:
         ✅ hero.psd — CMYK, 350ppi effective
         ⚠ icon_set.png — RGB (mismatch with CMYK document), 300ppi effective
         ❌ photo_bg.jpg — CMYK, 72ppi effective (over-enlarged)
           → Replace with a 300dpi+ image at actual size
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Check WCAG color contrast ratios</b></summary>

```
You:    Check text contrast ratios

Claude:  → check_contrast (auto_detect: true)

         ■ WCAG Contrast Report:
         ❌ "Caption" on "light gray" — 2.8:1 (AA fail)
         ⚠ "Subheading" on "white" — 4.2:1 (AA Large OK, AA Normal fail)
         ✅ "Body text" on "white" — 12.1:1 (AAA pass)
```

| `create_ellipse` | Create an ellipse |
| `create_line` | Create a line |
| `create_text_frame` | Create a text frame (point or area type) with optional tracking, leading and paragraph alignment. `font_name` must be the exact name from `list_fonts` — an unknown font is an error, not a silent fallback |

| `export_pdf` | Print-ready PDF export (crop marks, bleed, selective downsampling, output intent) |

</details>

### Utility (4)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `preflight_check` | Pre-press check (RGB mixing, broken links, low resolution, white overprint, transparency+overprint interaction, PDF/X compliance, etc.). Reports which checks were complete or only partial (`coverage`) |
| `check_text_consistency` | Text consistency check (placeholder detection, notation variation patterns, full text listing for LLM analysis) |
| `set_workflow` | Set workflow mode (web/print) to override auto-detected coordinate system |
| `set_illustrator_version` | Choose which Illustrator version to use when several are installed |

</details>

---

## Coordinate System

The server automatically detects the coordinate system from the document:

| Document type | Coordinate system | Origin | Y axis |
|---|---|---|---|
| CMYK / Print | `document` | Bottom-left | Up |
| RGB / Web | `artboard-web` | Top-left of artboard | Down |

- **CMYK documents** use Illustrator's native coordinate system, matching what print designers expect
- **RGB documents** use a web-style coordinate system that is easier for AI to work with
- Use `set_workflow` to override the auto-detected coordinate system if needed
- All tool responses include a `coordinateSystem` field indicating which system is active
- If auto-detection fails, tools return an error instead of guessing — pass `coordinate_system` explicitly or call `set_workflow`

---

## Example: SMPTE Test Pattern

A 1920×1080 SMPTE color bar test pattern, created entirely through natural language instructions to Claude.

## Example: Twilight Geometry

An abstract geometric landscape artwork — created entirely by Claude, with no human design direction beyond "make whatever art you want."

**Prompt:**

> Make an art piece of your own imagination in Illustrator. Take your time. Create whatever you like.

**Claude's process:**

> I'll create "Twilight Geometry" — an abstract landscape with geometric celestial elements. A deep gradient twilight sky, layered mountain silhouettes, a crescent moon with decorative rings, and stars scattered across the canvas.

> Diamond-shaped stars in different colors — warm whites, cool blues, lavender purples — each one subtly different to suggest different types of stars. Constellation lines connecting them. Wireframe triangles and a hexagon floating in the sky for a mystical atmosphere.

> A water surface at the bottom with the moon's light reflected as shimmering wavy lines, fading as they descend.

**Claude's reflection:**

> It turned out better than I expected. I think the hybrid world of geometry and nature came through well.

**Result:**

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| Windows support | Windows uses PowerShell COM automation (not yet tested on real hardware) |
| Live effects | Drop shadow and other effect parameters can be detected but not read |
| Color profiles | Color profile assignment only — full conversion is not available |
| Bleed settings | Bleed settings cannot be read (Illustrator API limitation) |
| WebP export | Not supported — use PNG or SVG instead |
| Japanese crop marks | PDF export draws the marks temporarily on the document with the TrimMark command, exports, then removes them. Single-artboard documents only — multi-artboard documents return an error |
| Font embedding | Embedding mode (full/subset) cannot be controlled directly — use PDF presets |
| Size variations | Proportional scaling only — text may need manual adjustment afterward |
| SVG text glyph fallback | Illustrator does not fall back per glyph across a `font-family` list. If the first family is installed but lacks a glyph, `import_svg_as_editable` drops that character silently and still reports success. Use one font-family per text element and choose one that contains the glyphs you need. An *uninstalled* family is substituted instead and is unaffected; `preflight_check` covers that separate case |
| Object notes | Tools identify objects by a UUID stored in each object's note (Attributes panel). A note you wrote yourself is kept — the UUID is added in front of it |

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ie3jp/illustrator-mcp-server.git
cd illustrator-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
claude mcp add illustrator-mcp -- node /path/to/illustrator-mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

### Verify

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx illustrator-mcp-server
```

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# E2E smoke test (requires Illustrator running)
npm run build   # E2E runs dist/index.js
npx tsx test/e2e/e2e-test.ts        # every tool (192 cases)
npx tsx test/e2e/e2e-behaviors.ts   # behavior & regression checks (91 cases)
npx tsx test/e2e/e2e-cmyk-only.ts
npx tsx test/e2e/svg-import-test.ts
```

The E2E suites create their own documents, never touch other open documents, and close them without saving. `e2e-test.ts` exercises every registered tool (RGB + CMYK, coordinate-system auto-detection); `e2e-behaviors.ts` checks behaviors that must hold on the real app — notes are preserved, partial failures are reported, files are not overwritten, crop marks and PDF export leave your artwork intact.

## Privacy Policy

illustrator-mcp-server runs entirely on your computer. It collects no personal data, has no telemetry, and makes no network connections of its own. Tool parameters and document data go only to your local Illustrator and back to the MCP client that called the tool; temporary files are deleted after each call. See the full [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/ie3jp/illustrator-mcp-server/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).

## Disclaimer

This tool automates many Illustrator operations, but AI can make mistakes. Extracted data, preflight results, and document modifications should always be reviewed by a person. **Do not rely on this tool as your sole quality check.** Use it as an assistant alongside your own manual verification, especially for print submissions and client deliverables. The authors are not responsible for any damages or losses arising from the use of this software or its outputs.
